In order to help and support physically and mentally challenged
children, with the help of philantropic individuals and corporate
organizations, we have initiated a noble program.

<p>Anybody can be a member of this program by donating rupees
thousand for a year.<br>
The amount thus collected will be utilized for the projexts of KIDS
Special School especially for the development of different abilities of
such unfortunate children of the society.</p>

It is truly a herculean task to inculcate self-independence among the
physically and mentally challenged children in view of the gravity and
seriousness of their problems and the intricacies involved in the
methods aimed at dealing with it.

<p>
 We have to train them to activate
their other faculties which may be subtle so that these children can be
trained to attend to their day to day activities and make a modest
earning lest they are considered burden to their families and/or the
society of which they are very much an integral part.&nbsp;</p><p>KIDS Special
School is an attempt with this broader objective in view.
